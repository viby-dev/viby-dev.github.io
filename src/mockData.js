bio: `I'm a robotics engineer building intelligent systems that bridge the gap between AI research and real-world deployment. My work focuses on multi-robot coordination connecting LLM-based task planning, VLM perception, and ROS2 execution into systems that actually work on real hardware.

Currently a Program Assistant at IIT Gandhinagar, where I work with platforms like Unitree Go2, TurtleBot3, and SO-101 arms. My research on CoMuRoS a hierarchical multi-robot architecture - has been published at IROS 2025 and ArXiv.

I care about robots that don't just simulate well, but deploy reliably.`,

    shortDesc: "Developed a generalizable hierarchical architecture for LLM-driven task planning and event-driven replanning in heterogeneous multi-robot teams, unifying centralized deliberation with decentralized execution.",
    
    fullDescription: `CoMuRoS is a hierarchical multi-robot architecture that bridges LLM-based task planning with real ROS2 hardware execution for heterogeneous robot teams.

## Task Manager LLM
Implemented a Task Manager LLM for natural-language goal interpretation and dynamic task allocation using static rules and contextual information including task history, robot status, and runtime events. Tasks are classified into four categories: Independent, Sequential, Coordinated, and Infeasible.

## Local Robot LLMs
Designed local robot LLMs that compose executable Python code from primitive ROS2 skills, with onboard VLM-based perception (OwlViT + GPT-4.1 VQA) for continuous event monitoring and classification.

## Hardware Results
- 90% collaborative object recovery success (9/10 trials)
- 100% coordinated transport success (8/8 trials)
- 100% human-assisted recovery success (5/5 trials)

## Benchmarking
Evaluated across 22 diverse scenarios (3 tasks each) with 8 LLMs. Achieved average correctness of 0.91 with Grok-3. Replanning dataset achieved perfect correctness (1.0) across all 5 scenarios.

## Key Capabilities
Demonstrated autonomous recovery from disruptive events, filtering of irrelevant distractions, and emergent human-robot cooperation through runtime replanning. Supports anytime human interaction — feedback, corrections, interruptions, or new commands.

## Stack
Developed using ROS2 Humble with Python, simulated in Gazebo Classic and Ignition Fortress. Tested on Unitree Go2, TurtleBot3 Burger, TurtleBot3 Waffle Pi with OpenManipulator-X.`,

    fullDescription: `The Poultry Patrol Robot is an autonomous agricultural robot developed as a B.E. final year project at Sahyadri College of Engineering and Management, designed to detect and mark diseased chickens in medium-scale poultry farms.

## Problem
Manual disease detection in poultry farms is labor-intensive and prone to error. Diseases like Salmonella and Coccidiosis can spread rapidly if not detected early, causing major economic losses.

## Robot Design
Designed a differential drive mobile robot in SolidWorks (full 2D and 3D) with a fabricated chassis using aluminum sheet metal, 3D-printed PLA parts, and black acrylic panels.

## Detection System
- Raspberry Pi 5 running YOLOv5 for real-time diseased chicken detection via webcam
- Trained on labeled dataset including movement-based sick chicken detection and faecal matter analysis
- Detects Salmonella (watery/discolored faeces, weak legs) and Coccidiosis (bloody streaks in stool)
- mAP@50 achieved: ~0.9

## Actuation
- Motor control via L298N motor drivers (4x Johnson DC motors at 200 RPM)
- Servo-actuated color sprayer mechanism to autonomously mark identified diseased birds
- ESP32 for distributed sensor acquisition and wireless telemetry

## ROS2 Architecture
Built on ROS2 with dedicated nodes for image capture (/camera → /img), ML inference (/detect → /yolov5/detections), object following (/object_follower), and motor control (/cmd_vel → /move).

## Testing
Tested in a real chicken farm at Beliyurukatte, Puttur. Plagarism and AI check passed (5% similarity, DrillBit).`,

## FEA Validation (SolidWorks Nonlinear)
- Deflection: 35.4mm (1.14% error)
- Shear stress: 397.2 MPa (22.36% error — expected due to stress concentration effects in nonlinear FEA)
